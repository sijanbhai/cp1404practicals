# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

My estimate accuracy was initially inconsistent, with some tasks taking longer than expected due to unforeseen challenges or underestimating the complexity.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

Over time, my estimates became more precise as I gained experience, understood the scope of tasks better, and learned to factor in time for debugging and testing.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learned the importance of breaking tasks into smaller components to estimate more accurately and the value of leaving buffer time for unexpected issues.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

I learned how others approach problem-solving and gained insight into best practices, such as improving code readability and following conventions. Constructive feedback also highlighted areas for improvement in my coding style.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

I improved my ability to critically analyze code, identify potential bugs or inefficiencies, and recognize good coding practices. It also reinforced concepts I might have overlooked in my own work.



Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[https://github.com/enolf/cp1404practicals/pull/5#issue-2667164167]()

### Explanation

Verified the functionality of the submitted code and identified areas where the logic could be enhanced. For example, I checked edge cases, such as how the program handles empty input or unexpected data types.
### Good Code Review 2

[https://github.com/REJCU/cp1404practicals/pull/5#issue-2646778089]()

### Explanation

Recommended more descriptive error messages to guide users effectively.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I would provide more real-world examples to connect concepts with practical applications and introduce collaborative tasks earlier to build teamwork skills.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I excelled at debugging and optimizing code, ensuring my solutions were efficient and met all requirements. I also stayed consistent with submitting tasks on time and actively engaged in peer discussions to improve my understanding.
