I am consistently attending classes and completing the weekly exercises. I also find that regularly reflecting on my progress helps me identify areas to improve and reinforces what I have learned.

I need to stop overcomplicating solutions and focus on writing clear, simple, and efficient code. Additionally, I should avoid distractions while working on practical tasks to maintain better focus and productivity.

It would be helpful to have more examples of real-world applications for the concepts weâ€™re learning, as this would provide context and make the material more engaging and relevant to industry needs.
